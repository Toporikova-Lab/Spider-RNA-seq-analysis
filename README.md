# Spider-RNA-seq-analysis
This repository contains the raw data and R scripts needed to reproduce figures from the manuscript: **RNA sequencing and mathematical modeling identify suite of light sensitive circadian genes in an orb-web weaving spider**
**To generate all figures from the manuscript, follow these steps:**
  1. Download or clone this entire respository into any local directory
  2. The scripts in the **"Figures"** folder were created using [R version 4.1.1](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/), so ensure **R version 4.1.1** is installed.
  3. The required R packaged are listed in *r_packages.txt*. Use the code in this file to install the packages. 
  4. The subfolder in the **"Figures"** folder were named by its corresponding figure in the manuscrip. Run the *.rmd* file in the subfolder without making any changes to the code. Results will be displayed directly in the RStudio environment. 

For more details, refer to the **README** located in each subfolder if applicable.
