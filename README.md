# Spider-RNA-seq-analysis
This repository contains the raw data and R scripts needed to reproduce figures from the manuscript: **RNA sequencing and mathematical modeling identify suite of light sensitive circadian genes in an orb-web weaving spider.**

**To generate Figures or Tables from the manuscript, follow these steps:**
  1. Download or clone this entire respository into any local directory.
  2. The scripts in the **"Figures"** or **"Tables"** folder were created using [R version 4.1.1](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/), so ensure **R version 4.1.1** is installed.
  3. The required R packages are listed in *r_packages.txt*. Use the code in this file to install the packages. 
  4. The subfolders in the **"Figures"** folder and the **"Tables"** folder were named by its corresponding figure or table in the manuscript. Run the *.rmd* file in the subfolder without making any changes to the code. Figures will be displayed directly in the RStudio environment. Tables will be created inside the subfolder.

For more details, refer to the **README** located in the subfolders if applicable.
