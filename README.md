# Spider-RNA-seq-analysis
The goal of this repository is to conduct analysis of spider RNA-seq experiment which was conducted in Summer 2018. This repository contains the raw data and R scripts needed to reproduce figures from the manuscript: **RNA sequencing and mathematical modeling identify suite of light sensitive circadian genes in an orb-web weaving spider**
**To generate all figures from the manuscript, follow these steps:**
>>1. Download or clone this entire respository into any local directory
>>2. These scripts were created using R version XXX, so ensure R version XXX is installed.
