# Spider-RNA-seq-analysis-Table S4

This folder contains raw data and R scripts needed to reproduce the *Additional File 5: Table S4.xlsx*

Run the *Table S4.rmd*, and *second_quadrant_t7t16.csv* and *second_quadrant_pulsenopulse.csv* will be generated.

Proteins corresponding to the match_id were searched in [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and added into the two tables with column name "Protein.name".

The two tables are then manually combined into *Additional File 5: Table S4.xlsx* as two sheets.
